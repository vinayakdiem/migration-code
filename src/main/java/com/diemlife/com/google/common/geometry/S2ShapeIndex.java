   * guaranteed to be linear in the number of input edges, where the constant of proportionality has
   * the form (c1 + c2 * (1 - f) / f). Reasonable values range from 0.1 to perhaps 0.95. Values up
   * to about 0.8 have almost no effect on 'normal' geometry except for a small increase in index
   * construction time (proportional to f) for very large inputs. For worst-case geometry, larger
   * parameter values result in indexes that are smaller and faster to construct but have worse
   * query performance (due to having more edges per cell). Essentially this parameter provides
   * control over a space-time trade-off that largely affects only pathological geometry.
   *
   * <p>Specifically, the maximum index size is <pre>O((c1 + c2 * (1 - f) / f) * n)</pre>, where n
   * is the number of input edges, f is this parameter value, and constant c2 is roughly 20 times
   * larger than constant c1. The exact values of c1 and c2 depend on
   * {@link Options#cellSizeToLongEdgeRatio} and {@link Options#maxEdgesPerCell} parameters and
   * certain properties of the input geometry such as whether it consists of O(1) shapes, whether it
   * includes polygons, and whether the polygon interiors are disjoint.
   *
   * <p>The main factors to consider when choosing this parameter are:
   * <ul>
   * <li>For pathological geometry, larger values result in indexes that are smaller and faster to
   * construct but have worse query performance, due to having more edges per cell. However, note
   * that even a setting of 0.1 reduces the worst case by 100x compared with a setting of 0.001.
   * <li>For normal geometry, values up to about 0.8 result in indexes that are virtually unchanged
   * except for a slight increase in index construction time, proportional to the parameter value f,
   * for very large inputs. With millions of edges, indexing time increases by about (15% * f), e.g.
   * a parameter value of 0.5 slows down indexing for very large inputs by about 7.5%. Indexing time
   * for small inputs is unaffected.
   * <li>Values larger than about 0.8 start to affect index construction even for normal geometry,
   * resulting in smaller indexes and faster construction times but gradually worse query
   * performance.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>The default value of 0.2 was chosen to make index construction as fast as possible while
   * still protecting against possible quadratic space usage.

    // the minimum value is 3.1 rather than 2.0 is that this ratio is defined in
    // terms of the average edge length of cells at a given level, rather than
    // their minimum width, and 2 * (S2::kAvgEdge / S2::kMinWidth) ~= 3.1.)
    //
    // Next we consider the long index entries.  Let c2 be the maximum number of
    // index cells where a given edge E was considered short in those cells'
    // parents.  (Unlike the case above, we do not require that these cells
    // intersect E.)  Because the minimum width of each parent cell is at least
    // some fraction of E's length and the parent cells at a given level do not
    // overlap, there can be at most a small constant number of index cells at
    // each level where E is considered short in those cells' parents.  For
    // example, consider a very short edge E that intersects the midpoint of a
    // cell edge at level 0.  There are 16 cells at level 30 where E was
    // considered short in the parent cell, 12 cells at each of levels 29..2, and
    // 4 cells at levels 1 and 0 (pretending that all 6 face cells share a common
    // "parent").  This yields a total of c2 = 360 index cells.  This is actually
    // the worst case for index_cell_size_to_long_edge_ratio >= 3.1; with the
    // default value of 1.0 it is possible to have a few more index cells at
    // levels 29 and 30, for a maximum of c2 = 366 index cells.
    //
    // The code below subdivides a given cell only if
    //
    //     s > f * (s + l)
    //
    // where "f" is the min_short_edge_fraction parameter, "s" is the number of
    // short edges that intersect the cell, and "l" is the number of long edges
    // that intersect the cell plus an upper bound on the number of shapes that
    // contain the entire cell.  (It is an upper bound rather than an exact count
    // because we use the number of shapes that contain an arbitrary vertex of
    // the cell.)  Note that the number of long index entries in each child of
    // this cell is at most "l" because no child intersects more edges than its
    // parent or is entirely contained by more shapes than its parent.
    //
    // The inequality above can be rearranged to give
    //
    //    l < s * (1 - f) / f
    //
    // This says that each long index entry in a child cell can be associated
    // with at most (1 - f) / f edges that were considered short when the parent
    // cell was subdivided.  Furthermore we know that there are at most c2 index
    // cells where a given edge was considered short in the parent cell.  Since
    // there are only n edges in total, this means that the maximum number of
    // long index entries is at most
    //
    //    c2 * (1 - f) / f * n
    //
    // and putting this together with the result for short index entries gives
    // the desired bound.
    //
    // There are a variety of ways to make this bound tighter, e.g. when "n" is
    // relatively small.  For example when the indexed geometry satisfies the
    // requirements of S2BooleanOperation (i.e., shape interiors are disjoint)
    // and the min_short_edge_fraction parameter is not too large, then the
    // constant c2 above is only about half as big (i.e., c2 ~= 180).  This is
    // because the worst case under these circumstances requires having many
    // shapes whose interiors overlap.

    // Continue subdividing if the proposed index cell would contain too many
    // edges that are "short" relative to its size (as controlled by the
    // FLAGS_s2shape_index_cell_size_to_long_edge_ratio parameter).  Usually "too
    // many" means more than options_.max_edges_per_cell(), but this value might
    // be increased if the cell has a lot of long edges and/or containing shapes.

   * contain the center of every S2CellId in the index, by advancing the focus from one cell center
   * to the next.
   *
   * <p>Initially the focus is S2.origin(), and therefore we can initialize the state of every shape
   * to its containsOrigin() value. Next we advance the focus to the start of the S2CellId space-
   * filling curve, by drawing a line segment between this point and S2.origin() and testing whether
   * every edge of every shape intersects it. Then we visit all the cells that are being added to
   * the S2ShapeIndex in increasing order of S2CellId.
   *
   * <p>For each cell, we draw two edges: one from the entry vertex to the center, and another from
   * the center to the exit vertex (where "entry" and "exit" refer to the points where the space-
   * filling curve enters and exits the cell). By counting edge crossings we can incrementally
   * compute which shapes contain the cell center.
   *
   * <p>Note that the same set of shapes will always contain the exit point of one cell and the
   * entry point of the next cell in the index, because either (a) these two points are actually the
   * same, or (b) the intervening cells in S2CellId order are all empty, and therefore there are no
