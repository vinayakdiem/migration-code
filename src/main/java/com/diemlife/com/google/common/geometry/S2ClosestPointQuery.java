/**
 * Given a set of points stored in an S2PointIndex, S2ClosestPointQuery provides methods that find
 * the closest point(s) to a given query point.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * void test(List<S2Point> points, List<S2Point> targets) {
 *   // The template argument allows auxiliary data to be attached to each point (in this case, the
 *   // array index).
 *   S2PointIndex<Integer> index = new S2PointIndex<>();
 *   for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
 *     index.add(points.get(i), i);
 *   }
 *   S2ClosestPointQuery<Integer> query = new S2ClosestPointQuery<>(index);
 *   query.setMaxPoints(15);
 *   for (S2Point target : targets) {
 *     for (Result<Integer> result : query.findClosestPoints(target)) {
 *       // result.entry().point() is one of the found closest points.
 *       // result.entry().data() is the auxiliary data (the "points" array index).
 *       // result.distance() is the distance to the target point.
 *       doSomething(target, result.entry().point(), result.entry().data(), result.distance());
 *     }
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>You can find either the k closest points, or all points within a given radius, or both (i.e.,
 * the k closest points up to a given maximum radius). E.g. to find all the points within 5
 * kilometers, call {@code query.setMaxDistance(S1Angle.fromEarthDistance(5000));}.
 *
 * <p>You can also restrict the results to an arbitrary S2Region via {@link #setRegion(S2Region)}.
 *
 * <p>The implementation is designed to be very fast for both small and large point sets.
 *
 * <p>This class is not thread-safe. In particular, setters must not be called during queries.
