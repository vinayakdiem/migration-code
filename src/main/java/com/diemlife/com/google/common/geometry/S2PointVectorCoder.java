  /**
   * Encodes a vector of {@link S2Point}s, optimizing for space.
   *
   * <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
   *
   * <p>We attempt to represent each S2Point as the center of an S2CellId. All S2CellIds must be at
   * the same level. Any points that cannot be encoded exactly as S2CellId centers are stored as
   * exceptions using 24 bytes each. If there are so many exceptions that the COMPACT encoding does
   * not save significant space, we give up and use the uncompressed encoding.
   *
   * <p>The first step is to choose the best S2CellId level. This requires converting each point to
   * (face, si, ti) coordinates and checking whether the point can be represented exactly as an
   * S2CellId center at some level. We then build a histogram of S2CellId levels (just like the
   * similar code in S2Polygon.encode) and choose the best level (or give up, if there are not
   * enough S2CellId-encodable points).
   *
   * <p>The simplest approach would then be to take all the S2CellIds and right-shift them to remove
   * all the constant bits at the chosen level. This would give the best spatial locality and hence
   * the smallest deltas. However instead we give up some spatial locality and use the similar but
   * faster transformation described below.
   *
   * <p>Each encodable point is first converted to the (sj, tj) representation defined below:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * sj = (((face & 3) << 30) | (si >> 1)) >> (30 - level);
   * tj = (((face & 4) << 29) | ti) >> (31 - level);
   * }</pre>
   *
   * These two values encode the (face, si, ti) tuple using (2 * level + 3) bits. To see this,
   * recall that "si" and "ti" are 31-bit values that all share a common suffix consisting of a "1"
   * bit followed by (30 - level) "0" bits. The code above right-shifts these values to remove the
   * constant bits and then prepends the bits for "face", yielding a total of (level + 2) bits for
   * "sj" and (level + 1) bits for "tj".
   *
   * <p>We then combine (sj, tj) into one 64-bit value by interleaving bit pairs:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * v = interleaveBitPairs(sj, tj);
   * }</pre>
   *
   * (We could also interleave individual bits, but it is faster this way). The result is similar to
   * right-shifting an S2CellId by (61 - 2 * level), except that it is faster to decode and the
   * spatial locality is not quite as good.
   *
   * <p>The 64-bit values are divided into blocks of size 8, and then each value is encoded as the
   * sum of a base value, a per-block offset, and a per-value delta within that block:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * v[i,j] = base + offset[i] + delta[i, j]
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>where "i" represents a block and "j" represents an entry in that block.
   *
   * <p>The deltas for each block are encoded using a fixed number of 4-bit nibbles (1-16 nibbles
   * per delta). This allows any delta to be accessed in constant time.
   *
   * <p>The "offset" for each block is a 64-bit value encoded in 0-8 bytes. The offset is
   * left-shifted such that it overlaps the deltas by a configurable number of bits (either 0 or 4),
   * called the "overlap". The overlap and offset length (0-8 bytes) are specified per block. The
   * reason for the overlap is that it allows fewer delta bits to be used in some cases. For example
   * if base == 0 and the range within a block is 0xf0 to 0x110, then rather than using 12-bits
   * deltas with an offset of 0, the overlap lets us use 8-bits deltas with an offset of 0xf0
   * (saving 7 bytes per block).
   *
   * <p>The global minimum value "base" is encoded using 0-7 bytes starting with the
   * most-significant non-zero bit possible for the chosen level. For example, if (level == 7) then
   * the encoded values have at most 17 bits, so if "base" is encoded in 1 byte then it is shifted
   * to occupy bits 9-16.
   *
   * <p>Example: at level == 15, there are at most 33 non-zero value bits. The following shows the
   * bit positions covered by "base", "offset", and "delta" assuming that "base" and "offset" are
   * encoded in 2 bytes each, deltas are encoded in 2 nibbles (1 byte) each, and "overlap" is 4
   * bits:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * Base:             1111111100000000-----------------
   * Offset:           -------------1111111100000000----
   * Delta:            -------------------------00000000
   * Overlap:                                   ^^^^
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>The numbers (0 or 1) in this diagram denote the byte number of the encoded value. Notice
   * that "base" is shifted so that it starts at the leftmost possible bit, "delta" always starts at
   * the rightmost possible bit (bit 0), and "offset" is shifted so that it overlaps "delta" by the
   * chosen "overlap" (either 0 or 4 bits). Also note that all of these values are summed, and
   * therefore each value can affect higher-order bits due to carries.
   *
   * <p>NOTE(user): Encoding deltas in 4-bit rather than 8-bit length increments reduces encoded
   * sizes by about 7%. Allowing a 4-bit overlap between the offset and deltas reduces encoded sizes
   * by about 1%. Both optimizations make the code more complex but don't affect running times
   * significantly.
   *
   * <p><strong>ENCODING DETAILS</strong></br>
   *
   * <p>Now we can move on to the actual encodings. First, there is a 2 byte header encoded as
   * follows:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * Byte 0, bits 0-2: encodingFormat (COMPACT)
   * Byte 0, bit  3:   haveExceptions
   * Byte 0, bits 4-7: (lastBlockSize - 1)
   * Byte 1, bits 0-2: baseBytes
   * Byte 1, bits 3-7: level (0-30)
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>This is followed by an EncodedStringVector containing the encoded blocks. Each block
   * contains BLOCK_SIZE (8) values. The total size of the EncodedS2PointVector is not stored
   * explicitly, but instead is calculated as
   *
   * <pre>
   * num_values == BLOCK_SIZE * (numBlocks - 1) + lastBlockSize
   * </pre>
   *
   * <p>(An empty vector has numBlocks == 0 and lastBlockSize == BLOCK_SIZE.)
   *
   * <p>Each block starts with a 1 byte header containing the following:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * Byte 0, bits 0-2: (offsetBytes - overlapNibbles)
   * Byte 0, bit  3:   overlapNibbles
   * Byte 0, bits 4-7: (deltaNibbles - 1)
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>"overlapNibbles" is either 0 or 1 (indicating an overlap of 0 or 4 bits), while
   * "offsetBytes" is in the range 0-8 (indicating the number of bytes used to encode the offset for
   * this block). Note that some combinations cannot be encoded: in particular, offsetBytes == 0 can
   * only be encoded with an overlap of 0 bits, and offsetBytes == 8 can only be encoded with an
   * overlap of 4 bits. This allows us to encode offset lengths of 0-8 rather than just 0-7 without
   * using an extra bit. (Note that the combinations that can't be encoded are not useful anyway).
   *
   * <p>The header is followed by "offsetBytes" bytes for the offset, and then (4 * deltaNibbles)
   * bytes for the deltas.
   *
   * <p>If there are any points that could not be represented as S2CellIds, then "haveExceptions" in
   * the header is true. In that case the delta values within each block are encoded as (delta + 8),
   * and values 0-7 are used to represent exceptions. If a block has exceptions, they are encoded
   * immediately following the array of deltas, and are referenced by encoding the corresponding
   * exception index (0-7) as the delta.
   *
   * <p>TODO(user): A vector containing a single leaf cell is currently encoded as 13 bytes (2 byte
   * header, 7 byte base, 1 byte block count, 1 byte block length, 1 byte block header, 1 byte
   * delta). However if this case occurs often, a better solution would be implement a separate
   * format that encodes the leading k bytes of an S2CellId. It would have a one-byte header
   * consisting of the encoding format (3 bits) and the number of bytes encoded (3 bits), followed
   * by the S2CellId bytes. The extra 2 header bits could be used to store single points using other
   * encodings, e.g. E7.
   *
   * <p>If we wind up using 8-value blocks, we could also use the extra bit in the first byte of the
   * header to indicate that there is only one value, and then skip the 2nd byte of header and the
   * EncodedStringVector. But this would be messy because it also requires special cases while
   * decoding. Essentially this would be a sub-format within the COMPACT format.
