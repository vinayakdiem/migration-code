/**
 * S2ConvexHullQuery builds the convex hull of any collection of points, polylines, loops, and
 * polygons. It returns a single convex loop.
 *
 * <p>The convex hull is defined as the smallest convex region on the sphere that contains all of
 * the input geometry. Recall that a region is "convex" if for every pair of points inside the
 * region, the straight edge between them is also inside the region. In our case, a "straight" edge
 * is a geodesic, i.e. the shortest path on the sphere between two points.
 *
 * <p>Containment of input geometry is defined as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each input loop and polygon is contained by the convex hull exactly (i.e., according to
 *       S2Polygon.contains(S2Polygon)).
 *   <li>Each input point is either contained by the convex hull or is a vertex of the convex hull.
 *       (Recall that S2Loops do not necessarily contain their vertices.)
 *   <li>For each input polyline, the convex hull contains all of its vertices according to the rule
 *       for points above. (The definition of convexity then ensures that the convex hull also
 *       contains the polyline edges.)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>To use this class, call the add*() methods to add your input geometry, and then call
 * getConvexHull(). Note that getConvexHull() does *not* reset the state; you can continue adding
 * geometry if desired and compute the convex hull again. If you want to start from scratch, simply
 * declare a new S2ConvexHullQuery object (they are cheap to create).
 *
 * <p>This class is not thread-safe.
