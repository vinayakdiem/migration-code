/**
 * An S2CellUnion is a region consisting of cells of various sizes. Typically a cell union is used
 * to approximate some other shape. There is a tradeoff between the accuracy of the approximation
 * and how many cells are used. Unlike polygons, cells have a fixed hierarchical structure. This
 * makes them more suitable for optimizations based on preprocessing.
 *
 * <p>An S2CellUnion is represented as a vector of sorted, non-overlapping S2CellIds. By default the
 * vector is also "normalized", meaning that groups of 4 child cells have been replaced by their
 * parent cell whenever possible. S2CellUnions are not required to be normalized, but certain
 * operations will return different results if they are not, e.g. {@link #contains(S2CellUnion)}.
