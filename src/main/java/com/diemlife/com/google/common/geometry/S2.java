  // is the planar centroid, which is simply the centroid of the ordinary
  // (non-spherical) triangle defined by the three vertices. Second, there is
  // the surface centroid, which is defined as the intersection of the three
  // medians of the spherical triangle. It is possible to show that this
  // point is simply the planar centroid projected to the surface of the
  // sphere. Finally, there is the true centroid (mass centroid), which is
  // defined as the surface integral over the spherical triangle of (x,y,z)
  // divided by the triangle area. This is the point that the triangle would
  // rotate around if it was spinning in empty space.
  //
  // The best centroid for most purposes is the true centroid. Unlike the
  // planar and surface centroids, the true centroid behaves linearly as
  // regions are added or subtracted. That is, if you split a triangle into
  // pieces and compute the average of their centroids (weighted by triangle
  // area), the result equals the centroid of the original triangle. This is
  // not true of the other centroids.
  //
  // Also note that the surface centroid may be nowhere near the intuitive
  // "center" of a spherical triangle. For example, consider the triangle
  // with vertices A=(1,eps,0), B=(0,0,1), C=(-1,eps,0) (a quarter-sphere).
  // The surface centroid of this triangle is at S=(0, 2*eps, 1), which is
  // within a distance of 2*eps of the vertex B. Note that the median from A
  // (the segment connecting A to the midpoint of BC) passes through S, since
  // this is the shortest path connecting the two endpoints. On the other
  // hand, the true centroid is at M=(0, 0.5, 0.5), which when projected onto
  // the surface is a much more reasonable interpretation of the "center" of
  // this triangle.
